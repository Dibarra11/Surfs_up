# Surfs_up

##  Project Overview

Utilizing SQL Lite, SQL Alchemy, and Flask, an app was created to analyze weather patterns to determine if opening a surfing shop on a Hawaiian Island is a good business idea.

## Results

Data from June and December were analyzed to determine the feasibility of opening the surf shop.

## Summary

The data suggest that opening the surf shop is a good idea. Data shows during June, a max temperature of 85 degrees, a low of 64 degrees, and an average temperature of 74.9 degrees throughout the month, indicating good surfing conditions. For December, the max temperature is 83 degrees, a low of 56, and an average temperature of 71 degrees throughout the month which still indicates to be acceptable weather for surfing.

An additional query for finding patterns in wind speeed would be beneficial as surfing depends on wind and wave sizes. Additionally, additonaly a query to track precipitation in the island would help optimize surfing conditions.
